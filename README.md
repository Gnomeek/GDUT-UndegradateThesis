# GDUT-UndegradateThesis
Latex Template

### How to use it

- only modify files in data folder
- put refers in /ref/refs.bib
- put your figures in figure folder
- you can customize your thesis template by editing gdutthesis.cls

### How to use it decently

- I recommend Sublime and LaTexTools to compile and generate pdf in case using terminal is complicated and indecent
- you can get a tutorial on this [site](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E9l9akguR1bOhd-Q4wruCg). This tutorial is on MacOS, how to build LaTex environment is basically no differences between MacOS, *nix and Windows 
- Tutorial for LaTex Syntax can refer to handbook, which is contributed by the original template improver.

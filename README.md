Latex Template

Now This repo also includes a Word template!(03/13/2020)

**Star/Fork this repo or Share it with your friends can really help me. Thanks a lot.**

## Latex Part
### How to use it

- Only modify files in data folder
- Put refers in /ref/refs.bib(in BibTex format)
- Put your figures in figure folder
- You can customize your thesis template by editing gdutthesis.cls(hope you know what are you doing)

### How to use it decently

- I recommend Sublime and LaTexTools to compile and generate pdf in case using terminal is complicated and indecent
- You can get a tutorial on this [site](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E9l9akguR1bOhd-Q4wruCg). This tutorial is on MacOS, how to build LaTex environment is basically no differences between MacOS, *nix and Windows 
- Tutorial for LaTex Syntax can refer to handbook, which is contributed by the original template improver.


### Issues
- Use \subfig rather than \subfigure, issued by [ElenHuo](https://github.com/ElenHuo)

## Word Part
### How to use it

- Well, it's a word template, I believe everyone knows how to use it.

### How to use it decently
- You can use [Endnote(Paid software)](https://endnote.com/) or [Zotero(Free and Open-Source)](https://www.zotero.org/) to build your reference system. In this way, you can refer more decently and get rid of lots of troubles with their help.
- You can still add references manually and remember to follow GBT7714 strictly. See document in handbook folder for more information.

## TODO

- [ ] Chinese version readme
